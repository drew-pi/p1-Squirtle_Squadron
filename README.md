### Our Project
 - Create a higher-lower game that involves apis that would retrieve the population of 2 random cities and you would have to guess whether or not the 2nd city would have a higher or lower population. It has 2 gamemodes:classic with unknown random cities/towns from the U.S and a famous editon:with more famous international cities.
