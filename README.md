### Our Project
 - Create a higher-lower game that involves apis that would retrieve the population of 2 random cities and you would have to guess whether or not the 2nd city would have a higher or lower population. It has 2 gamemodes:classic with unknown random cities/towns from the U.S and a famous editon:with more famous international cities.

    ```$ git clone git@github.com:drew-pi/p1-Squirtle_Squadron.git```
    
2. Enter the repository

    ```$ cd p1-Squirtle_Squadron```

3. Download all of the necessary modules and libraries by running the following command in your terminal (for some devices use ```pip3``` instead)

    ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

4. Navigate to the Python script on your machine

    ```$ cd app/```

5. Then start the website by executing ```__init__.py```

    ```$ python3 __init__.py```
